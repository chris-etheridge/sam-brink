                               "<p>In 2016, I collaborated to create a more alternative project. For this brief we were asked to look at ourselves and who we are in the spaces and places which we occupy. We were asked to look at ourselves physically and metaphysically, as well as our self-image. So its clear that this brief explore more introspective themes.</p>
<p>Through this process, I discovered certain attributes about myself and how they constitute my self-image and identity. I found that I am an organised, and obsessively creative person as well. My group chose to stitch into our hands as a means to make this project immediately recognisable as being a self-awareness project, and to actively engage in who we are through using our bodies as a medium.</p>
<p>The significance of using the threads I used, was because of the colour psychology of colours. Black is the color of the hidden, the secretive and the unknown, creating an air of mystery. I keep to myself in certain social situations, closing myself off in some ways I suppose. Purple is the color of the imagination. It can be creative (which is the meaning I used it for) and individual or immature and impractical (which is definitely not what I used it for).Blue is the color of trust and peace. It can suggest loyalty and integrity as well as conservatism and frigidity.</p>
<p>I wanted the composition of the threads on my hand to convey the sense of mystery, secrecy and confusion. I used the hand as a means to create organic, irregular shapes, but resorted to using my fingertips and threading them together to show more form and rigidity as a means to give the composition a sense of structure.</p>"

                               "<p>The brief was to delve into my hard earned wisdom and life lessons, and celebrate these through illustration or photography. I was asked to identify the advice which I would like to communicate, and create a series of three images which pack a punch and visually portray the advice I have to give.</p>
<p>For many years, the most popular sea stories and fables of the ocean have depicted sea creatures and the oceans as a hostile and dangerous place. Sea creatures are depicted as cruel beasts which should be confronted with aggression as well as caution. My key insight for this project is thatethere are very few ocean related stories which shed a positive light on the relationship between humans and animals co-existing. </p>
<p>I wanted to make this project personal as well, and this was a major reason for choosing the ocean and the lessons which I have learnt from it. As a child, I avoided the ocean and swimming in any body of water because of the fear of what was lurking beneath me. As I got older though, my attitude became the complete opposite. I saw this brief as an opportunity to convey my own narrative and experiences.</p>
<p>The solution to the issue which I discovered through my key insight, is to portray scenes which emphasise and highlight how humans rely on and need the ocean and its creatures. These images, in order to pack the punch, need to be detailed and interesting to look at in order to hold viewer’s attention, while also focusing on the ocean aspect of the theme.</p>

                               "<p>Over the past couple of years that Diomande has been working with shoes, he came to the realization that this is a dying craft mostly likely due to the fact that the majority of the population buy cheap, mass-produced shoes. The problem with these is you keep having to buy shoes every couple of years or, even worse, every couple of months. It makes so much more sense to splurge out on one or two really good pairs. The misconception of cheap, synthetic shoes being ‘a good buy’ aligns with the direction the entire world is going with the idea of just about everything being disposable and replaceable. </p>
<p>Shoe-making is one of the oldest crafts dated and one that has been handed down from generation to generation and is now on the brink of being lost. This publication hopes to re-emboss the importance of such craft and lay bare on Diomande’s life long passion and manifesto.</p>
<p>The concept behind this publication is: ‘A stitch in time’, derived from the traditional saying “A stitch in time saves nine” meaning that if you do something well the first time, it will save you time and/or money in the end. Diomande can easily be seen as a man born for a different era, misplaced in time; most of the tools in his workshop are traditional, opposed to modern, heavy machinery. If you’re wise enough to buy a pair of shoes from Diomande, it's going to be your most unique item. Honestly, not many people in today’s time can say that their shoes were handcrafted and specially designed to fit their feet using trace paper.</p>
<p>For the publication, I worked with various different types of materials including; rubber at the bottom of the book to represent the sole of the shoe. Next was a layer of cork, to represent the wooden sole of the shoe. The layer of foam board was used to mock the inside sole of the shoe/padding and then lastly, the leather felt to mimic the material that is used on the inside of leather shoes. Beeswax is a traditional and useful product, often used on leather shoes to help protect them from the water. The cover of the book was essentially used to represent the top cover/upper of the leather shoe and then the traditional wax thread was used to for binding, the same thread used when stitching together leather shoes.
The overall tone of the publication was practical, self-made and, very precise. The book itself was entirely made from my own hands. Not many students can say that they hand stitched their entire publication. This type of independence is seen and hopes to represent Diomandes strong passion and desire to succeed in life. </p>
<p>The layout of the publication takes the form of an ‘organized chaos’, paragraphs are randomly placed and full of movement. The space in which Diomande works is very dark, dingy and unorganized to the average person eye however to Diomande, this space is not messy or unorganized as if you were to ask him wherever his tool was he would be able to show you.</p>

This year, Vega School exhibited work at the Open Book Comics Fest in Cape Town again, in the form of the Parallelogram: Volume 2 publication.The publication encouraged students to be subversive and to explore the nature of self-publishing. The brief gives free reign over content and responded critically to topics such as sex, race, gender, addiction, romance, politics and more. "

                               "<p>The brief encouraged contributions that were critical in their approach and did not shy away from taboo topics. The brief also called on subversive, autobiographical content. Ultimately, I had to explore local topics and develop my own visual vernacular that had a local South African flavour, either in it’s tone or in it’s visuals.</p>
<p>The theme for this years edition of the Parallelogram publication was Urban Dystopia, and I chose to focus on the topic of beggars and homelessness in the city of Cape Town. I saw this as a kind of dystopia because many people perceive beggars to be undesirable and that confronting homelessness is unpleasant for many wealthier communities.</p>
<p>Influenced by South African Resistance Art, I created a lino cut silent narrative highlighting the ‘problem’ of beggars concentrated at traffic lights in the city. The name ‘Change for a loosey’ comes from the urban slang for a ‘loosey’ which is a single cigarette usually bought from a store clerk instead of buying a full pack of cigarettes. The ‘loosey’ is pretty relevant to the thinking behind this brief. Many homeless beggars which I have personally met often ask for change followed by asking for a cigarette (or a loosey). ‘Change for a loosey’ is also a subtle metaphor for the little amount of change/help those who can afford it seem to give to the poor. I personally also have seen many homeless people spend their hard earned change on looseys.</p>
<p>This project is personally something which I really enjoyed making. I love working with my hands and really enjoy working with lino cuts. The medium I felt really strengthened the message and I learnt a new respect for South African Resistance Art. I hand burnished the lino cuts on 60% cotton Fabriano paper. The brief called for a 21x21cm book which I also enjoyed working with. Many of my illustrations are done pretty small and I decided that I’d take advantage of using a smaller canvas in this project. </p>

                               "<p>For this brief, I collaborated to create a powerful social awareness campaign for a South African brand, that would add value to society. Choosing to create an awareness campaign for the Red Apple Dyslexia Association, we aimed to highlight their efforts to support, educate and train those suffering from dyslexia and those living with dyslexia sufferers.
The concept behind this campaign was to simply put our target in the shoes of a dyslexic. We want our audience to be able to empathise with the sufferers, and to be able to try and relate to them on a more personal level. </p>
<p>The purpose of this campaign is to educate, create awareness regarding the cause, and bring to light the seriousness of this disability. The two print campaigns clearly consist of childhood nursery songs, making the copy instantly recognisable. Using childhood songs also evokes a sense of empathy towards the sufferers of dyslexia. The visuals link to the nursery rhymes just in case anyone was still unsure. </p>
<p>The copy at the bottom of the print advertisements is confrontational and challenges the viewer’s confidence in something which they cannot easily read. At the end of the day, this commercial aims to confront the viewer by the idea that dyslexia is more common than one would think and that their children might have this disability without them even knowing.</p>

<p>Cittaslow signifies and emphasizes on how individuals need to slow down and be more observant towards natural elements that benefit life on Earth rather than man-made, mass produced products. This has been emphasised by a folklore style that intends to communicate the tradition of simple life. </p>
<p>We conceptualised a beer menu for the brewery which they could use at the tasting bar on the premises. The menu contains the relevant information for each of their six beers, as well as the story behind each beer and the beers description.

<p>The client had no pre-existing visual brand identity and struggled with packaging the soaps since they are always different in size. The brand purposefully had no ‘set’ range and therefore are continuously changing. The amount of possible essential oil combinations means that these soaps can cater to a variety of consumer preferences.</p>
<p>The visual identity was inspired by geographical illustrations of natural landscapes and formations on the surface of the earth, which was relevant to the brand in a handful of ways, one being that the only thing that remains constant in life is change. Every mountain, hill or river are never drawn the same, just how each illustration on the soap labels will never be the exact same.</p>
<p>
<p>The packaging consists of an extra-length, wrap-around label which encapsulates the soap and is then sealed with a sticker containing all the relevant details and information, as well as featuring a helpful list of the natural remedies each soap provides. The design is simple, time-efficient, and light on the wallet, however, still pleasing to the eye, fulfilling all of the client’s requirements.</p>
